  <h1>Lap steel</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>During the 2023 spring semester I made a lap steel. Lap steels –sometimes called Hawaiian guitars– is a guitar designed to play with a slide which originated in the Hawaiian islands in the late 1800s. The name “lap steel” generally seems to refer to the electric variety although there also seem to be acoustic lap steels.</p>

<h3 id="what-doesshould-a-lap-steel-look-like">What does/should a lap steel look like?</h3>
<p>Lap steels are kind of strange aesthetically speaking. They often look either like a keytar or a 2x4 with strings. Some of them have a violin-bass-y shape, but the shape somehow rarely feels like it fits the instrument. Utilitarian is maybe a word that could be used to describe many lap steels. This is totally fine, especially because many lap steels literally are 2x4s with guitar hardware, but the silly shape makes a little less sense if its a Gretsch or something like that.</p>

<p>I did some sketches and messed around in Solidworks and came up with something ok. Most of the time I find sketching to be very useful but this time I went straight to CAD and that worked. I think this is because I had a pretty clear idea of what I wanted to make and the form was quite simple.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/angle_screen.png" alt="_config.yml" />
<img src="/images/lap_steel/side_screen.png" alt="_config.yml" />
<img src="/images/lap_steel/top_screen.png" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>Acoustic guitar style tuners, bridge pickup, very stiff (sustain), weight not as much of a concern. I wanted to keep the body pretty flat so it would sit well on the lap, but I also wanted an angled headstock because I think they look nice. I also wanted the neck to taper towards the end. This would help accentuate the headstock shape and I thought it would make the instrument look a little bit less like a brick.</p>

<h3 id="roughing-the-body">Roughing the body</h3>

<p>I drew the profile on the block of wood in pencil and cut the profile on the bandsaw.</p>

<p>Next, I turned the block on its side and cut the profile of the angled headstock. I flattened the top of the headstock with a plane and refined the bottom with a chisel and sandpaper.</p>

<p>Then, using a combination of chisels, gouges, and planes, I removed material from the body to create a raised “fretboard” area. This has no real purpose other than aesthetic but I think it does important work breaking up the big shape of the body and adding some visual interest.
<img src="/images/lap_steel/01_b.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h3 id="headstock">Headstock</h3>
<p>The headstock needed a little something more than what I had in CAD, so I drew a three lobed design and cut the profile on the bandsaw, further refining it with sandpaper and files. It was challenging to file the profile without tearing out the wood, so the sandpaper did a lot of the work.</p>

<p>I then drew the slots for the tuners and used the drill press to remove most of the material. I was concerned about tear out from the drilling so I first drilled some small holes and then used forestner bits to remove most of the material. This worked relatively well although it required a fair amount of cleanup afterwards.</p>

<p>At this point I also cut a slot for the nut with a chisel.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/03_headstock_drill_progress.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>I cleaned up the slots with a file and sandpaper. Again, the file was challenging to use because of tear out so the sandpaper ended up being more useful.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/03_headstock_drilling_2.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>Tear out was a concern again when drilling holes for the tuners. Especially on the inside of the surface where the drill bit would be exiting the wood. To avoid this, I hammered a conveniently sized piece of wood into the slot, making sure that the fit was quite tight. This way, as the drill exited the walnut, the fibers on the surface would be held in place by the added board. This worked relatively well although it was not perfect.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/04_drilling_tuning_holes.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h3 id="shaping-and-test-fits">Shaping and test fits</h3>
<p>Before continuing to shape the body, it was time to place the major hardware and do a test fit to make sure everything was in the right place. I drilled holes for threaded inserts for the bridge and tailpiece and installed the inserts with a mallet. As an aside, every screw that goes into the body of this instrument goes into a threaded insert so it can be removed without worrying about stripping out the wood. Threaded inserts for wood work very well and although they do take up more space, the ability to reinstall screws without worrying about stripping out the wood is well worth it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/05_threaded_inserts_body.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>I installed the nut with machine screws into small threaded inserts at the bottom of the nut slot. Test fitting a string made me relatively sure that this could really become an instrument someday.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/05_fit_check.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>Next, I chamfered the edges of the body with a plane and a file. This was not based on the CAD, but instead was based on how it felt and how it interacted with the grain of the board (which turned out to be one of my favorite parts of the instrument).</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/06_shaping_body.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h3 id="body-details">Body details</h3>

<p>When the curve of the body had been finalized, I was now able to figure out the maximum depth for the pockets in the back of the instrument. The design of the rear pocket was more of less completely informed by what was happening on top of the instrument. In addition to the curved top surface, the position of the potentiometers was important for playability and aesthetically. I placed the knobs on top of the instrument and moved them around until they felt right. I did the same with the instrument jack.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/08_pickup_dry_fit.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>I drew the shape on the top of the body and transferred it onto the back for cutting. I don’t have pictures of that process, but I used forestner drill bits and a depth stop on the drill press and it wasn’t all that exciting.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/07_pocket_design.JPG" alt="_config.yml" />
Next, it was time to carve a slot under for the underside of the pickup. The wires from the pickup travel underneath it. Some of the pole pieces stuck out the bottom and the casing had some bumps which required reliefs in the body if the pickup was to sit flat. This did not need to exact because the large flange of the pickup would cover it all.</p>

<p>At this point, I could also drill the hole for the instrument jack. From the beginning, I had known that the jack would not go on the top of the instrument like it does on some lap steels. With a 90 degree instrument cable this can look fine, but I find that it still looks messy. The remaining options were the front face, the rear face, and the right face of the instrument. Many lap steels have the instrument jack on the “front” face of the instrument (facing away from the player) and this works fine, however, this is the side that the audience sees and it would be nice if it looked as pleasant as possible. Plugs are an important part of electric instruments, but they are not a very pleasant looking part. The solution ended up being to put the jack on the “back” face of the instrument (facing the player) which is a relatively uncommon decision. In order to make it work, I moved the jack as far towards the right side of the instrument as possible so the cable and plug wouldn’t be near the player’s right leg.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/07_jack_and_pickup_slot.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>It was also at this point that I drilled the holes for the wires between pockets in the back of the instruments. I used an aircraft drill and some angled pieces of plywood which helped me keep the angle of the bit correct while drilling. Each step was slightly more nerve wracking than the previous because the whole instrument was one piece of wood. It wasn’t as if I could replace any of the parts if I messed them up, it was all one part.</p>

<h3 id="fretboard">Fretboard</h3>

<p>The final piece of the design puzzle was to figure out how to indicate the fret positions. The lap steel is played with a steel (much like a slide guitar). The player decides what note to play by pressing the steel on the string at a given position. Unlike on a guitar, the string is not pressed against a fret or the neck of the guitar. Despite there being no need for actual frets, it is helpful for playability to indicate where useful positions are on the neck of the instrument. For this reason, many instrument designers choose to put frets on their lap steels despite the fact that the strings are never actually fretted. They are simply a way of indicating note positions that many players are very familiar with. I didn’t want to use frets because they felt like they didn’t make sense because the main function of the fret was not used.</p>

<p>I considered a few different ways of indicating note positions. I was interested in doing some sort of inlay, but I couldn’t decide what. It would help if the note indicators were large or easily visible so that they could be useful to the player. However, the steel must be positioned quite precisely otherwise the note will sound out of tune, so a large indicator may not provide precise enough information about where to place the steel. I needed something small and visible, like a fret.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/20_frets_exploration_3.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>In the end, I decided to place small dots where the frets would be. The dots would be stainless steel so they stood out on the walnut body. I did some practice on an offcut from the body with finish applied to make sure that they were easy to see against the wood.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/20_frets_1.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>I used stainless welding rod which comes in standard sizes and is easy to work with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/20_frets_3.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h3 id="finishing">Finishing</h3>
<p>Sanding this thing took a loong time. I did it by hand and went up to 600 grit. The result was satiny smooth and felt very nice in the hands.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/15_sanding.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>For the finish, I used boiled linseed oil. Some new inlays are also visible in this picture. Guitars often have inlays to indicate certain frets to help the player move around the neck more easily. I wanted to include these indicators, but didn’t want them to fight for the player’s attention with the fret indicators so I turned a small dowel out of the same walnut as the body on the lathe. The walnut had significant color variation between its darkets and lightest spots, so I tried to put the dark parts of the dowel into the light parts of the body and vice versa to create contrast.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/25_stain_2.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h3 id="final-pics">Final pics</h3>

<p>Here are some nice pictures of the instrument (taken before the fret markers were put in). I am particularly pleased with how the grain complements the curves of the body on the front of the instrument.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lap_steel/35_outdoor_2.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>And here’s the back. 
<img src="/images/lap_steel/35_outdoor_3.JPG" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>The body is walnut. For the tuners, I bought classical guitar tuners on ebay. The gear ratio is slightly different from electric guitar tuners but that doesn’t really make a difference.</p>

<p>The nut is a nickel lap steel nut, the potentiometers and jack are standard guitar hardware and the bridge/tailpiece are Les Paul style. The pickup is a Gretsch G5700 Electromatic lap steel pickup.</p>
