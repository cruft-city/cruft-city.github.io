  <h1>Fundamental assumptions in science</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>It is hard (perhaps impossible) to do science and engineering without bias. This comes up a lot in the social sciences and in medical science and medical device design. This basis can be along racist or sexist lines. Biases fundamentally underly all science and engineering.</p>

<p>We should think (as individuals) about the purpose of the science that we do. When we categorize things, do we necessarily impose hierarchy?</p>

<p>I want to do science in order to learn about the wonderfully different life that this world (and perhaps others) contain. I also want to know about the things that make things (living and otherwise) different, and what makes them similar. The academic (and corporate) setting of science can do a huge amount to completely stifle the spirit of inquiry among scientists, but it behooves us to try our best to foster it. Whether this means reminding ourselves about our fundamental curiosity, helping foster that curiosity in a student or a friend, or helping design and create systems to foster that feeling, that feeling of unbridled curiosity should be what science exists to foster.</p>

<p>Engineering exists on the other side of the same coin. We build becuase we are curious as well. We build in order to make the world better, and we must foster this feeling.</p>
