<p>The cool night wind shifted imperceptibly as it ran over the astronomer’s long hair, knotted atop his head. nearby in the woods a family of deer spooked and darted through the brush and a dog barked –– perhaps earlier than usual –– but the astronomer did not stir, he was engrossed in his task. On this clear night, he was observing the moon and it would take his entire attention. The dogs barked every night, but tonight, a different sound would break Zhang Heng’s reverie. It would be a tiny sound, then something louder, sharp and metallic. A chilling sound, terrifying for its implication. It would begin in inaudibly subtlety, a precisely balanced pendulum was nudged ever so slightly by vibrations in the earth, then, as it fell it struck a ball nestled gently in the mouth of a metal dragon. Zhang Heng may not have heard the first strike of the pendulum, but he would have heard the ball fall. At that moment, he would have known instantly why the dogs were barking early. For an earthquake had struck, and his seismograph told him where. No vibrations had been felt, and Zhang Heng’s rivals in the court of Emperor Shun ridiculed the presumed failure of the seismograph until later, when a messenger arrived at court from Gansu province to report a brutal earthquake. The messenger had come from 300 miles away. Zhang Heng’s device was the first of its kind, and possessed incredible precision. The year was 132 AD.</p>

<p>Zhang Heng’s seismograph was one of the earliest known scientific uses of the pendulum. His device used an inverted pendulum (a pendulum precariously balanced upside down, an unstable configuration), which fell at the slightest seismic vibrations. When the pendulum fell, it dislodged one of a four balls arrayed around it to indicate the direction the earthquake came from [1].</p>

<p>But this is just the start of the pendulum’s story, the beautifully simple machine still had much to teach us.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-pendulum">What is a pendulum?</h3>

<p>This might be obvious, but for the sake of starting off right, let’s start at the very beginning. The place where it all began. What is a pendulum? Generally, a pendulum consists of a joint that rotates and mass that rotates around that joint. That’s maybe too general, but we usually find pendulums oriented vertically, like an arm hanging from a shoulder, so hopefully that narrows it down. However, we will see later that sometimes it’s helpful to take a broad view about what qualifies as a pendulum. Unfortunately, this vague definition may not have been as enlightening as I’d hoped it would be so I’ve attached a few images of common pendulums that should clear up any lingering ambiguity before we forge ahead into unknown territory.</p>

<p>PICTURE OF PENDULUM HERE</p>

<p>The pendulum is a simple thing, conceptually at least. Which is part of why it is so important, not only as a machine, but also as a mechanism for thinking about stability, oscillations, and more.</p>

<h3 id="resonance-and-the-pendulum-as-a-clock">Resonance and the pendulum as a clock</h3>

<p>Somewhere after pendulums detected earthquakes in the palaces of ancient China and before they appeared in the homework of engineering a physics students, the humble pendulum was the beating heart inside of the most accurate clocks ever built.</p>

<p>Light pours into the pews, setting the dusty air ablaze in long slanted pillars. Under the tall ceilings rich with gold leaf and richly frescoed walls, a boy of seventeen looks over the bowed heads of the others in prayer. And, as the story goes, he cranes his neck upwards to watch the chandeliers, seeming to float on their gilded two-story tall chains as they swing gently. Counting heartbeats in the pious silence of the great Cathedral of Pisa, the young Galileo Galilei is said to have made a surprising discovery. Each swing of the chandelier took the same amount of time, no matter how wide the oscillations were. In his workshop in Florence, Gallileo made plans for a pendulum clock as early as 1583, and even described to his son Vincenzio how a pendulum based clock could be made, but the clock was never made. Instead, the first pendulum clock wouldn’t arrive for another 74 years until 1657 when the illustrious Christian Huygens –– himself a great inventor –– independently designed and built one. Between 1657 and sometime in the 1920’s or 1930’s, pendulum clocks were the most accurate way to tick away the passing seconds [3]. These new clocks wouldn’t contain pendulums, but the pendulum would live on in the vacuum tube and quartz crystal clocks to follow.</p>

<p>The pendulum is useful for timekeeping because it <em>resonates</em>. At a high level, resonance is vibrating and every object does it. No matter how large or small. The frequency of the vibrations depend on the size of the object and every object has a so called resonant frequency, and it is happiest vibrating at that frequency. The resonant frequency is the frequency that you’ll find that particular object vibrating at after it is hit or otherwise excited. Bigger objects have lower (or slower) resonant frequencies, and smaller objects have higher (or faster) resonant frequencies. Some things are so big that the resonance looks like waves that we can see or feel and we can determine the individual peaks as they move slowly (or stand still in the form of a standing wave). Some things are so small and they resonate so fast that we cannot even perceive their vibrations such as atoms (although we cannot see atoms anyway, so it doesn’t make much difference). Stiffness plays a role as well. Stiff things have higher resonant frequencies and floppy things have lower resonant frequencies. Air and fluids can also resonate, but the resonant frequency of these depend on the size of the container that they are in. The fundamental idea of resonance is that, when you add energy to the system, it shows up as vibrations, most of which occurs at the resonant frequency. When you are swinging on swingset –– finding yourself grotesquely transformed into yet another pendulum, there’s no avoiding them now –– no matter how hard you pump your legs, you will always swing at the same frequency. You cannot pump harder to increase the <em>frequency</em> of your swinging, you can only increase the amplitude. If you had a friend or two with you, they could pull and push you at a frequency faster or slower than the resonant frequency, but as soon as they stop, your swinging would once more occur only at the resonant frequency. If you shrunk yourself and your swingset down to a particular size, you would complete one swing per second, and then you’d be a wonderful clock. You could pump your legs to keep the oscillations going, but the time it took to do one oscillation –– called the “period” of the oscillation –– would remain the same because you’d be going at the resonant frequency of the tiny swing set. In this case, it would be one cycle per second, or 1 Hz.</p>

<p>The resonant frequency of the pendulum depends entirely on it’s geometry (how long it is and how much it weighs), this means that the resonant frequency will stay almost exactly the same (only changing with thermal expansion of the pendulum). Energy can be lost through friction at the joint, or friction with the air, but if more energy is added, it will not change the frequency of the clock. This is extremely handy for keeping time. Oscillation is essential to keeping time, and resonance is the best way to keep those oscillations uniform. All clocks after the pendulum clock used resonant oscillations of some form, whether it was mechanical resonance in a tuning fork or resonant electrical oscillations in a vacuum tube or quartz crystal. But the pendulum had still other wisdom.</p>

<h1 id="a-note-on-natural-frequency-vs-resonant-frequency-vs-first-mode">A note on natural frequency vs. resonant frequency vs. first mode</h1>
<p>in both theory and practice, the natural frequency, resonant frequency, and first mode all mean slightly different, very specific things and I’m not going to go into detail about that because I want to keep this ~ f ~ u ~ n ~, but check out the references at the end of the post for more in depth writing about this topic. Also check out the Wikipedia articles for natural frequency etc.</p>

<h3 id="pendulums-slings-and-bolas">Pendulums, slings, and bolas</h3>
<p>The resonant nature of pendulums makes them useful for timekeeping because the period of their oscillations is remarkably consistent. But resonance has another curious property. Zhang Heng’s pendulum seismograph may have been one of the first known scientific use of a pendulum, but bolas, slings and similar tools are much, much older. These weapons and tools are also pendulums and were incredibly fashionable technologies as recently as 6,000 BC [2]. Bolas and slings are weights which are placed in a strap and swung around, when they are swinging sufficiently fast, the operator can release the weight as a projectile for hunting or warfare.</p>

<p>Bolas and slings illustrate a second, important property of resonance. When the slinger swings the sling above their head, they moves their wrist back and forth and over a few swings, that motion transfers enough energy into the stones to be a useful hunting weapon. But how is this energy transfer so effective? It turns out resonance and the natural frequency are very useful in describing how energy flows. If you imagine swinging a sling, or a bucked or water, or any other weight, you can easily understand this relationship. If you were to move your hand in <em>very</em> slow circles, the weight would probably turn around you, but it would not spin quickly, and it would reach a relatively slow top speed. Now, if you were to move your hand in <em>very</em> fast circles, much faster than the weight “wants” to be swung, it might flop around, but it would not spin reliably in a circle with any great speed. Yet, intuitively, there is this speed that the weight “wants” to be swung at in order to make it spin fast, what is that? If you imagine yourself swinging anything, you can probably intuitively imagine how fast it “wants” to be swung. You can probably imagine that it depends on the weight of the object, and how far it is from you. It is, in fact, the natural frequency yet again. When you swing something at the natural frequency of the system made up of you, your arms, and the object, you are able to most effectively transfer energy into that system. When you swing it too slow, it doesn’t swing up, but when you swing too fast, the energy somehow misses its mark, and doesn’t actually make it swing any faster.</p>

<p>This same principle can be found all over. For instance, when a guitar player plucks a string, they are exciting the string and causing it to vibrate. The pitch (or frequency) at which the string vibrates does not depend on how they pluck the string, it depends only on the properties of the string, including its stiffness and how long it is. The guitarist can effectively change the length of the string by pressing it down on the fretboard. This is very similar to changing the length of a pendulum. This length, often called the “characteristic length” is very important for understanding why resonance occurs. In another case, a flute player blows air over the mouthpiece of a flute, exciting the air within and causing it to vibrate. If the flutist had no way of covering or uncovering hole on the flute, it would always play the same frequency, the natural frequency of the whole flute, determined by its length. However, by covering and uncovering holes along the body of the flute, the flutist can effectively change the length of the resonant cavity, much like fretting a string on a guitar. Once again, resonance allows us to produce oscillations with very consistent frequencies, however now with an added twist. When we add energy to the system in a disorderly way, such as by plucking a string, we notice that the system is only excited at the natural frequency. Energy at other frequencies, if it existed, is quickly lost.</p>

<p>Sometimes resonance is useful. When keeping time and playing music for example. Sometimes, however, it can be destructive. Some of the most classic examples of dangerous resonance have been found in bridges. A bridge –– especially a long bridge –– is in some ways very much like a long string and as you might expect, they also have natural frequencies. But, as we will also see, an understanding of why things oscillate and resonate derived from pendulums can also provide solutions to the potential dangers of runaway resonance, even in tricky and hard to diagnose forms.</p>

<h3 id="a-tale-of-two-bridges-modes-and-damping">A tale of two bridges, modes and damping</h3>

<p>On a cold day in Tacoma, November 7, 1940, Leonard Coatsworth, a reporter at <em>The News Tribune</em> in Tacoma was a firsthand witness to a disaster that every civil engineer in North America would learn about for decades to come. He reported “around me I could hear concrete cracking. I started back to the car to get the dog, but was thrown before I could reach it. The car itself began to slide from side to side on the roadway. I decided the bridge was breaking up and my only hope was to get back to shore. On hands and knees most of the time, I crawled 500 yards or more to the towers … My breath was coming in gasps; my knees were raw and bleeding, my hands bruised and swollen from gripping the concrete curb … I risked rising to my feet and running a few yards at a time … Safely back at the toll plaza, I saw the bridge in its final collapse and saw my car plunge into the Narrows.”</p>

<p>The engineers who designed the bridge had made plans to avoid dangerous oscillations and these prevented the bridge from oscillating up and down like a guitar string by attaching support cables along its length. However, string-like oscillation was only one of the ways that the Narrows Bridge could oscillate, another was twisting. Each of these ways of vibrating is called a “mode”. The engineers prevented energy from exciting the string-like vibrating mode of the bridge, but that just redirected energy into the second lowest mode: the twisting mode, and so the bridge twisted. The wind provided the energy and November 7, 1940 proved to be a particularly windy day.</p>

<p>INCLUDE PICTURE OF TWISTING BRIDGE from here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0xohjV7Avo</p>

<p>This presents an interesting challenge. Two modes were important in the Tacoma Narrows Bridge: bending, and twisting. The engineers who designed the bridge were able to make the bridge stiffer against bending, raising the frequency of the bending mode, and therefore preventing it from resonating. But by leaving the twisting mode unchanged, they allowed another path for energy entering into the system. They had some control over the energy flow between these modes, but not enough to prevent it from falling down.</p>

<p>Another good example of how unintuitive resonance can be is the Millennium Bridge in London. The prizewinning design for the bridge was first opened in June of 2000, forty years after the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster and almost 5,000 miles away. Londoners flocked to the opening, queueing up for a chance to cross this fancy new bridge. As the pedestrians began to cross the bridge, it began to sway. Not up and down, and not in twisting, but side to side and so severely that the bridge was closed that same day. This side to side swaying mystified engineers. It wasn’t windy, and the footsteps of pedestrians didn’t seem a likely cause. A vertical footstep didn’t seem a likely source of energy for a horizontal swaying. The true cause was much more subtle. The bridge had a bending resonant frequency in the sideways direction, and this mode could be excited by even a small source of energy, that was true. But what was sustaining the vibrations? After observing the motion of the bridge in a number of different experiments, the engineers figured it out. It turned out that people produce a small sideways force when they walk. The force generated by this motion from a single Londoner walking across the bridge is tiny, and others walking nearby might easily cancel it out with their own small sideways forces, but that’s not what happened. It turns out that people have an unconscious tendency to walk in synch. Walking in synch produced enough force to cause the bridge to sway ever so slightly, and this tiny swaying caused people everywhere on the bridge to synchronize in response. The horizontal forces generated by hundreds of people unintentionally walking in unison was enough to cause horizontal motion in the bridge of up to 70mm.</p>

<p>Once they had figured out the problem, the engineers looked at two possible routes for solutions. The resonance was being excited by footsteps, and people walk at approximately 2 Hz. If the resonant frequency of the sideways bending mode of the bridge could be raised high enough, the footsteps would no longer excite it. In order to do this, the bridge would need to be stiffened up significantly. The alternative would be to keep the bridge the same, but add something that was capable of removing energy from the resonance to keep the motion in check. This proved to be the easier fix and the engineers added <em>dampers</em> –– shock absorbers filled with fluid –– to the bottom of the bridge. These dampers remove energy from the oscillations through friction in the fluid as the shock absorber moves. This friction is energy from the bridge’s motion converted into heat in the fluid. In 2002, two years, £5 million, and 89 dampers later, the bridge opened again and the vibrations did not return.</p>

<h3 id="resonant-modes">Resonant modes</h3>

<p>Resonant modes may seem complicated. How many are there? What do they look like? How do we predict them? And to some extent, they are indeed complicated. There are engineers and scientists who dedicate their whole lives to understanding resonance in bridges alone. However, resonant modes can also be intuitive. Resonant modes occur in every direction that an object can be bent and twisted. A mode is low frequency when the length in the direction of the bending is long. For instance, the vibrating of a string is due to up and down (or side to side) bending in the string. The length involved in that motion or “characteristic length” is the full length of the string, which can be quite long. If we were to twist a string though, the characteristic length is the thickness of the string –– much smaller than the length. This means that the frequency produced by the string in bending is much lower than the one produced by the string in twisting (also called torsion).</p>

<p>Returning once again to the inverted pendulum we found in ancient China, but this time, instead of letting it fall, we’d like to keep it standing even under disturbances.</p>

<p>Claude Shannon on his unicycle, juggling.</p>

<p>The first person credited with robotic pendulum balancing is Claude Shannon, in 1951 he built a broomstick balancing robot and then convinced his friends to build and control a double pendulum. Shannon’s system used a little cart that drove back and forth at the base of the broomstick to balance it [Raibert], this problem is very similar to balancing a broomstick on your hand. If we simplify the system further, the broomstick is an object with a center of mass and a point on the ground where it receives contact forces. This is interesting because if we make a simple model of a human standing, the human has a center of mass and some number of feet contacting the ground. We can model the contact forces on the human’s foot or feet using a single net force which acts somewhere between the two feet (inside the convex hull of the feet). This point is called the center of pressure. So now we have a human that has a center of mass and a contact point (center of pressure) and contact forces which can vary in time, this is exactly our inverted pendulum.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if we neglect rotational inertia, the net contact force must act along the line from the center of mass to the center of pressure. This means that the only real way to balance would be to move the center of pressure around and we do this by shifting our weight between our feet or by taking a step. This assumption that we can neglect rotational inertia is ok in some ways because it simplifies the problem significantly, but its also unfortunate because much of the interesting dynamic behavior humans are capable of is enabled by strategic use of angular momentum (think swinging your arms). So although it is a valid assumption, by using it, we are limiting the behavior that we can get from the system.</p>

<p>You can also model walking and running using the inverted pendulum. When in stance, forces act from the foot, when in flight the system obeys a ballistic trajectory and so it is easy to predict where it will end up. The foot locations can be controlled in order to control force direction in order to allow for continued running.</p>

<p>This is how the robots at the Leg Lab in the 1980’s walked autonomously [video], and it is also how more modern robots like Little Hermes can accurately reproduce the motions of human operators while remaining balanced [video].</p>
