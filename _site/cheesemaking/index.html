Cheesemaking round one: the fall from grace and the redemption\</p>

<p>\f0\b Attempt 1, disaster at the dairy\</p>

<p>\f1\b0 First time trying to make mozzarella was a big failure.<br />
New England cheesemaking recipe for water bath mozzarella (no microwave).<br />
This was my first time curdling milk. The curds seemed to form as the recipe told me they would. As I cut them, I didn'92t cut all the way to the bottom of the pot, the curds continue almost all the way to the bottom. Apart from this, everything seemed to be progressing as expected.<br />
The next step in the recipe was to '93briefly drain the curds and then quickly knead them together OR SOMETHING'94. The recipe says that this kneading should happen in a hot water bath (180F) and that if one didn'92t have thick rubber gloves to wear, that it could be done with a spoon. <br />
<br />
This is where my problems began. I had probably been too rough with them up until this point, but as soon as I tried to '93knead'94 the curds together with the spoon they exploded into a bunch of tiny pieces which only got smaller the more I tried. At this point, things are looking very grim. There are no large curds remaining, everybody is now tiny particles about a couple of millimeters in diameter floating around. <br />
<br />
Determined to have something edible (rather than drinkable at the end), and having just about given up on it being mozzarella, I took a fine strainer and used a wooden spoon to press my curd particulate into the strainer, pushing out the whey. Eventually I was able to form a sort of ball consisting of compacted curd particles. I attempted to knead this ball as described in the recipe, but it would not hold together. Instead, I removed the ball and put it in the fridge, this would be the reward for my lack of tact handling the curds.<br />
<br />
The resulting cheese was both better and worse than expected. It was '93edible'94, although that'92d definitely too low a bar. The taste was fine, kind of ricotta like, but the texture was the major problem. It was grainy and the individual particles of curd were clearly discernible. The whole cheeseball was also not well combined and the little particles would come off when handled. It was not springy as one would expect from mozzarella and unfortunately it was spreadable, very un-mozzarella. Generally, an abject failure, but I was able to survive eating some of it spread on a salty cracker though this is not recommended. <br />

\cf0 Hoping for redemption, I tried a half recipe with the intention of being much more gentle with the curds. Also, I used the recipe DESCRIBED ON YOUTUBE. Which describes the key kneading step in greater detail alongside a demonstration.<br />
<br />
The curds again formed as expected and I made sure to cut them down to the bottom of the pot. This time I transferred the curd as gently as I possibly could and managed to keep them mostly intact. It felt like I was being ridiculously gentle with the curds, but whenever I tried to go a little faster they started to fall apart, there really is not a lot holding those bad boys together. With the curds more of less successfully ladled into a colander, I attempted to do the next step described in the video: picking up the curds with your hands and squeezing out excess whey. There was no way this was going to happen, the curds were in no way stuck together and were still incredibly fragile. There was effectively nothing solid to pick up, so I squeezed the pile of curds against the side of the colander, removing a good deal of whey but the curds were no stronger.<br />
<br />
It now seemed to me like this whole thing might be a bust. I might begin my cheesemaking career 0 for 2. But, since I hadn'92t yet completely destroyed my curds, I had one more thing to try. In the video, the curds are placed in a glass bowl and hot water is ladled onto them in order to maintain their stretchiness and malleability. I didn'92t yet have malleability or stretchiness, but I thought that if I could melt the curds together this way, there might still be hope. I gingerly transferred the mostly intact curd-pile to a glass bowl and ladled on some 180F whey from the original pot. I also salted the cheese in this step.<br />
<br />
The video suggested leaving the curdball submerged in hot whey for 15-20 seconds to restore stretchiness. I tried this, but it was clearly not long enough to melt the curds, so I tried it for two minutes. This time, after pouring off the whey, I started to notice the shiny taffy-like texture of mozzarella in some areas, however most of the ball still looked like a pile of whey and there would be no picking it up and stretching it. The only way out is through, so kneaded the curds in the bowl a little bit and then ladled on some more 180F whey until it was once again submerged. After four rounds of 1-2 minute hot water baths and gentle kneading, the curd-pile had become more of a log and it finally began to stretch. <br />
<br />
After the third round, there was some stretching, but it began to tear. After the fourth bath, it was really stretching, at this point I decided it was mozzarella enough for me and I gave it some more stretches and a final shaping into a nice log and then sent it to the fridge. <br />
<br />
The resulting log certainly had many of the qualities one would desire in a mozzarella, it was springy, when overstretched it broke into long stretchy, stringy bits, and it was fully homogeneous and held up well to handling. The texture also felt like mozzarella, it was stringy and a little bit squeaky when bitten, but the taste was not ideal. Initially, there is almost no flavor at all, then slowly a very plain milky, mozzarella-y flavor comes in. However, it seemed to be much weaker than I was expecting. It was utterly plain. <br />
<br />
With the addition of a little bit of table salt, it tasted more like what I was expecting. It would seem as though the salt I put in the hot whey bath did not get incorporated into the cheese. At this point, I'92m just thankful its not spreadable. What I made is close enough to mozzarella to feel like a success. The key learning was to be extremely gentle with the curds and that the process of melting the curds together should be done gently and with much care. <br />
