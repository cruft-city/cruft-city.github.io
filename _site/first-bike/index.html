  <h1>The golden pig</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>In her 1895 book on the subject, feminist and prohibitionist Frances Willard called the bicycle a “steed that never tires, and is ‘mettlesome’ in the fullest sense of the word” [1]. Although I agree in principle, I hope that my bicycle always has tires.</p>

<p>Willard thought so highly of the bicycle and its potential as an equalizing force for women that she wrote a book called “A Wheel Within a Wheel” all about her journey with the bicycle. Over the winter, I had a chance to make a tireless, two-tired steed of my own. Here’s how it went.</p>

<h3 id="the-bike">The bike</h3>

<p>The bike was going to be made of steel. <strong>___ inch thick __</strong> inch diameter <em>__</em> steel tubing to be exact. I had always wanted to make a bike (and learn to weld), and luckily Jack Whipple was running a bike building course at the <a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/">D-Lab</a> and was kind enough to let me in. Jack cut the tubes on the fablight and provided everything necessary to turn them into a bike, including unending patience and advice. Without him, there would be no bike. He also got a frame jig which turned out to be essential in making something bike-shaped, but more on that later. The design was based on the Surly Steamroller (Surly has frame dimensions and drawings on their <a href="https://surlybikes.com/bikes/steamroller">website</a>).</p>

<h3 id="the-basics">The basics</h3>

<p>The first essential piece of the bike building puzzle that I was lacking was the ability to MIG weld. Jonhenry and Jack were kind enough to teach me how to do that, although I am still very much a beginner and this bike frame is evidence of that fact. I started with a number of short pieces of practice tubing which I mangled badly. Eventually, after I learned how to stop blasting holes through the metal, it was time to attempt the real thing.</p>

<p>As it turns out, tacking the frame together was easy. Tacking with the MIG welder is like using extremely hot glue.</p>

<p>PICTURE OF TACKED FRAME</p>

<p>One of the unexpectedly convenient aspects of tacking the frame together was the ability to push and pull on the frame once tacked until it was straight and true. This could be accomplished by putting a long 2x4 through the main triangle of the frame and pulling hard unti lthe frame was straight. Even if one tack weld broke, the other three on each joint generally held true, making this a remarkably flexible method of putting together a frame.</p>

<p>It was time to paint the frame. From my expert experience, painting can be broken down into two distint and equally intractable challenges. The first: deciding what to paint. The second: actually painting it.</p>
