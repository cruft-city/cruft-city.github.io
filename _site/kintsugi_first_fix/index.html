  <h1>The first fix</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I like to fix things. The feeling of starting with something that doesn’t work and finishing with something that does is very satisfying. Perhaps this is why I have found kintsugi to be fascinating for such a long time. The practice of repairing a broken ceramic vessel and doing so in a way that augments the piece sounded wonderful. It seemed to me to highlight the aspects of repairing something that I found to be satisfying. One of the reasons I like fixing things so much is that, by fixing something which is broken you are both physically repairing it, but also imbuing it with deeper meaning by taking the time and care to do the fix. By doing the fix well and taking the time to make it beautiful, you imbue that much more meaning into the object and it means all that much more. Fixing things makes them mean more to yourself and those who use them, it also makes them less likely to be thrown away. It helps us get to know and care about the world of objects that surround us, and perhaps the greater world as well.</p>

<p>Anyway, for a couple of years, every time a ceramic object that meant something to me broke or chipped, I collected it before it could be thrown away and squirreled it away with the others until the urushi (lacquer sap), tonoko (clay powder), and finely milled gold powder arrived from Japan. I ordered the supplies from <strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong> and although they took many months to arrive, they were exactly what I wanted and seemed to be of good quality.</p>

<h3 id="the-tools">The tools</h3>
<p>Here is a list of ingredients a tools that I used and how I used them. I read a good deal about kintsugi and the ceramics that I fixed have been quite strong for a number of months now, but I an absolute beginner so take all of this with a grain of salt and definitely do your own research and validate these recommendations using more trustworthy sources.</p>

<p>PICTURE OF ALL THE TOOLS</p>

<p>Ki urushi - concentrated sap from the <em>Toxicodendron vernicifluum</em> tree.
Bengara urushi - this urushi is dyed red and is used for making a smooth layer over the top of the urushi-flour mix which holds the shards together.</p>

<p>Cake flour - mixed with urushi to form mugi-urushi which is used to join fragments together. The gluten in the flour makes gives the mixture some strength while the urushi is curing. I used an approximately 1:1 ratio of flour and urushi.</p>

<p>Tonoko - a finely ground clay powder which is mixed with urushi to form sabi-urushi which can be used to fill small cracks and chips. It produces a veru nice, hard, smooth surface. It does not have the elasticity of mugi-urushi and if too much is used, it can flow slightly while curing making it only suitable for small areas.</p>

<p>Isopropyl alcohol - can be used to clean ceramics, dissolve wayward urushi before it is cured, and clean the working area.
Vegetable oil - dissolves uncured urushi especially useful for cleaning and storing brushes.</p>

<p>Palette knife - used for applying mugi-urushi to the shards along the breaks. Also useful for mixing and scraping.
Thin brush - used for applying a thin line of bengara urushi on top of dried mugi-urushi to create a smooth surface.
Big brush - used for dusting the gold powder onto the second coat of bengara urushi to finish the process.</p>

<p>Humidity and temperature controlled box: used to cure the urushi after each step. I used an aquarium/terrarium temperature and humidity controller with a small space heater and small humidifier, although if the weather was hot enough, this could probably have been done in a cardboard box with a wet paper towel.</p>

<p>Glass work surface: urushi is very sticky and can be hard to clean. I used a piece of glass as a working surface for mixing the different combinations of urushi because it was easy to clean.</p>

<p>A important safety note: urushi contains a chemical called <em>urushiol</em> which causes skin rashes similar to poison ivy. In fact, urushiol is the same substance in poison ivy and poison oak which causes itchy rashes. Urushi should not cause these rashes when fully cured, but if you are sensitive to poison ivy, be careful.</p>
