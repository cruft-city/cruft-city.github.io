  <h1>Viola part 1, the early days</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I started working on a viola at the beginning of the pandemic after deciding that I wanted to get better at woodworking. A viola seemed like a good thing to try for a few reasons. The viola is detailed and requires precision but is small and can be made from cheap wood. For this reason, it could be a good project for learning. If I mess up, I don’t really waste anything but my own time. The viola is also made of parts which means that for most of the steps, if I mess up, I only have to re-make a single part. This is not true after the viola has been assembled, but I wasn’t worried about that yet.</p>

<p>This would go on to be a very long project and the early parts are where my inexperience would show the most. Most of the major quirks of the final instrument came from decisions and mistakes made at the earliest stages.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-you-start">Where do you start?</h3>
<p>Normally, when you make a violin family instrument (violin, viola, cello, bass), you start with the ribs – the sides of the instrument – and then you cut out the top and bottom of the instrument to match. I didn’t do that. I had no way of reliably making thin pieces of wood and additionally had no idea how I would form the wood into the desired shape. The ribs would have to wait.</p>

<p>Instead, I started with the top and bottom of the instrument. I had some pine shelves that weren’t being used anymore and were just about the right size. Normally, the back of the instrument is supposed to be made of flamed maple and the top of spruce but all I had was pine so that’s what it was going to be.</p>

<p>From the beginning, I found the “making the violin” website (http://www.makingtheviolin.com/) and set about trying to follow those steps. I printed out their template and used it to cut the top and back profiles from the shelf.</p>

<p>I also printed out their arching templates and used them to begin carving the arched surface of the top of the violin. I had ordered a set of the cheapest gouges I could find and they were working just fine on the soft pine.</p>
