  <h1>New Balance Workshop</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>A few years ago I got to do a workshop with some designers from New Balance. It was very cool to learn how they approach the design of footwear. I used Houdini and took a procedural approach to the designs.</p>

<p>New Balance provided us with two data sets. One of them contained the strain values in a shoe upper corresponding to fast direction changes while running. The other was the strain developed in the sole of a shoe during running. I visualized the two datasets in the following picture.</p>
