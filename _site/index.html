      <h1><a href="/viola/">Viola part 1, the early days</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I started working on a viola at the beginning of the pandemic after deciding that I wanted to get better at woodworking. A viola seemed like a good thing to try for a few reasons. The viola is detailed and requires precision but is small and can be made from cheap wood. For this reason, it could be a good project for learning. If I mess up, I don’t really waste anything but my own time. The viola is also made of parts which means that for most of the steps, if I mess up, I only have to re-make a single part. This is not true after the viola has been assembled, but I wasn’t worried about that yet.</p>

      <h1><a href="/lap_steel/">Lap steel</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>During the 2023 spring semester I made a lap steel. Lap steels –sometimes called Hawaiian guitars– is a guitar designed to play with a slide which originated in the Hawaiian islands in the late 1800s. The name “lap steel” generally seems to refer to the electric variety although there also seem to be acoustic lap steels.</p>

      <h1><a href="/kintsugi_first_fix/">The first fix</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I like to fix things. The feeling of starting with something that doesn’t work and finishing with something that does is very satisfying. Perhaps this is why I have found kintsugi to be fascinating for such a long time. The practice of repairing a broken ceramic vessel and doing so in a way that augments the piece sounded wonderful. It seemed to me to highlight the aspects of repairing something that I found to be satisfying. One of the reasons I like fixing things so much is that, by fixing something which is broken you are both physically repairing it, but also imbuing it with deeper meaning by taking the time and care to do the fix. By doing the fix well and taking the time to make it beautiful, you imbue that much more meaning into the object and it means all that much more. Fixing things makes them mean more to yourself and those who use them, it also makes them less likely to be thrown away. It helps us get to know and care about the world of objects that surround us, and perhaps the greater world as well.</p>

        <p>Quadratic programs are everywhere. They underly many fundamental computational processes like finite element analysis (matching boundary conditions across different domains of the simulation) and force control algorithms for balancing robots (calculating minimum force solutions while respecting constraints). Today we’re going to solve some of them using an algorithm called <em>active set</em>.</p>

        <p>My parents have had this old medium format camera sitting on a shelf for years and years. It turns out that this camera is none other than the Meopta Flexaret V. A medium format camera which was manufactured in the Czech Republic in 1958 (it was Czechoslovakia back then). I think it was a wedding present. Recently I became interested in trying to take some pictures with it.</p>

        <p>All those test pads on that tiny motor controller (LINK TO FIRST POST) weren’t originally intended for solder. This kinematically coupled, pogo pin powered, magnetically clasping bad boy was always part of the plan. I just had to absolutely drain all of the patience out of my body re-soldering programming wires a million times before I actually got around to making it, but here we are. Now instead of making progress on the board, let’s yak shave away a spring break making a fun little programming jig.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <h3 id="something-fundamental">Something fundamental</h3>
<p>The cool night wind shifted imperceptibly as it ran over the astronomer’s long hair, knotted atop his head. nearby in the woods a family of deer spooked and darted through the brush and a dog barked –– perhaps earlier than usual –– but the astronomer did not stir, he was engrossed in his task. On this clear night, he was observing the moon and it would take his entire attention. The dogs barked every night, but tonight, a different sound would break Zhang Heng’s reverie. It would be a tiny sound, then something louder, sharp and metallic. A chilling sound, terrifying for its implication. It would begin in inaudibly subtlety, a precisely balanced pendulum was nudged ever so slightly by vibrations in the earth, then, as it fell it struck a ball nestled gently in the mouth of a metal dragon. Zhang Heng may not have heard the first strike of the pendulum, but he would have heard the ball fall. At that moment, he would have known instantly why the dogs were barking early. For an earthquake had struck, and his seismograph told him where. No vibrations had been felt, and Zhang Heng’s rivals in the court of Emperor Shun ridiculed the presumed failure of the seismograph until later, when a messenger arrived at court from Gansu province to report a brutal earthquake. The messenger had come from 300 miles away. Zhang Heng’s device was the first of its kind, and possessed incredible precision. The year was 132 AD.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>A few years ago I got to do a workshop with some designers from New Balance. It was very cool to learn how they approach the design of footwear. The idea behind the workshop was to reimagine some aspect of footwear. The design I went with was a sports shoe designed to be as light and still provide good support. The upper would be knit for fit and breathability. Surrounding the uppoer is an organically inspired plastic mesh to provide stiffness and support. I used Houdini and took a procedural approach to the designs.</p>
