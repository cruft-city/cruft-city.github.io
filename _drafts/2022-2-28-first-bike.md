Over the winter, I had a chance to make a bike frame and learn to weld at the same time. Here's how it went.

### The bike

The bike was going to be made of steel. _____ inch thick ____ inch diameter ____ steel tubing to be exact. I had always wanted to make a bike (and learn to weld), and luckily Jack Whipple was running a bike building course at the [D-Lab](https://d-lab.mit.edu/) and was kind enough to let me in. Jack cut the tubes on the fablight and provided everything necessary to turn them into a bike, including unending patience and advice. Without him, there would be no bike. He also got a frame jig which turned out to be essential in making something bike-shaped, but more on that later. The design was based on the Surly Steamroller (Surly has frame dimensions and drawings on their [website](https://surlybikes.com/bikes/steamroller)).

### The basics

The first essential piece of the bike building puzzle that I was lacking was the ability to MIG weld. Jonhenry and Jack were kind enough to teach me how to do that, although I am still very much a beginner and this bike frame is evidence of that fact. I started with a number of short pieces of practice tubing which I mangled badly. Eventually, after I learned how to stop blasting holes through the metal, it was time to attempt the real thing.

As it turns out, tacking the frame together was easy. Tacking with the MIG welder is like using extremely hot glue. 

PICTURE OF TACKED FRAME

One of the unexpectedly convenient aspects of tacking the frame together was the ability to push and pull on the frame once tacked until it was straight and true. This could be accomplished by putting a long 2x4 through the main triangle of the frame and pulling hard until the frame was straight. Even if one tack weld broke, the other three on each joint generally held true, making this a remarkably flexible method of putting together a frame. 

While welding the frame together, I jumped around the frame, trying to avoid putting too much heat into any given area to avoid warping. This did the trick, and my frame needed no pushing or pulling once welded. Some parts of the frame were incredibly hard to reach with the welder. None worse than the point where the chainstays come together on the bottom bracket. This is the joint at the bottom of the bike where the pedals go into the bike, and it containts some of the toughest to access nooks and crannies on the whole frame. The correct way to accomplish this weld would probably be to build up a puddle in a place that is easy to access, and then lead the puddle around the tube into the unreachable zone. Once the weld puddle is established, it is easier to move around and maintain it, rather than starting a puddle in a hard to reach area. This is easier said than done and I'll just say that I'm glad those welds are on the bottom of the bike.

Welding the head tube was probably the most nervewracking part of the process because it was made of thinner walled tubing and therefore would be easier to blow through. On these joints, I tried to keep most of the heat in the thicker walled downtube and top tube. I actually overcompensated and burned away a small amount of the top tube, but was able to fill the hole easily enough. These actually turned out to be some of the more acceptable welds on the frame. 

After the welding process was complete, I did a good deal of grinding and hand filing in a more or less futile attempt to hide my shame. The grinding definitely reduced some of the more aggregiously lumpy welds, but a moderate size reduction and some general smoothing was the best I could hope for. With that, it was time to put it together and see if it would support a rider.

### Graphic design is my passion

It was time to paint the frame. From my expert experience, painting can be broken down into two distint and equally intractable challenges. The first: deciding what to paint. The second: actually painting it.

I made a sketch of the general distribution of colors that I wanted on the frame.

From there, I started designing the decals.
