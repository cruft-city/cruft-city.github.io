A few years ago I got to do a workshop with some designers from New Balance. It was very cool to learn how they approach the design of footwear. I used Houdini and took a procedural approach to the designs.

New Balance provided us with two data sets. One of them contained the strain values in a shoe upper corresponding to fast direction changes while running. The other was the strain developed in the sole of a shoe during running. I visualized the two datasets in the following picture.

Here are a couple of the pictures Eleanor took with Portra 400 film and the Kern-Paillard Yvar 75mm lens.
