To see how we got into this mess, check out part 1 HERE.

The boards arrived! They are indeed very small: (PICTURE OF BOARD WITH FINGERPRINT)


Now to get assembling... I'm using a cheap hot air rework station from China and some tweezers. I made a huge blunder and decided not to get the solder stencil with my boards, that is not something I will do again.
At first, the 0402s were getting away from me, they would blow away as I tried to place them on the board, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly and now they go on like a breeze.


In this post, we're going to turn on the microcontroller and get diverted making a programming jig for this tiny little guy.
