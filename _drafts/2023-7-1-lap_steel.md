During the 2023 spring semester I made a lap steel. Lap steels –sometimes called Hawaiian guitars– is a guitar designed to play with a slide which originated in the Hawaiian islands in the late 1800s. The name "lap steel" generally seems to refer to the electric variety although there also seem to be acoustic lap steels.  

### What does/should a lap steel look like?
Lap steels are kind of strange aesthetically speaking. They often look either like a keytar or a 2x4 with strings. Some of them have a violin-bass-y shape, but the shape somehow rarely feels like it fits the instrument. Utilitarian is maybe a word that could be used to describe many lap steels. This is totally fine, especially because many lap steels literally are 2x4s with guitar hardware, but the silly shape makes a little less sense if its a Gretsch or something like that.

I did some sketches and messed around in Solidworks and came up with something ok.

Acoustic guitar style tuners, bridge pickup, very stiff (sustain), weight not as much of a concern.
