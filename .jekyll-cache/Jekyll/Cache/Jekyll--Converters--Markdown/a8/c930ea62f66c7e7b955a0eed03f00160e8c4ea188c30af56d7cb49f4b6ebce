I"<p>All those test pads on that tiny motor controller (LINK TO FIRST POST) weren’t originally intended for solder. This kinematically coupled, pogo pin powered, magnetically clasping bad boy was always part of the plan. I just had to absolutely drain all of the patience out of my body re-soldering programming wires a million times before I actually got around to making it, but here we are. Now instead of making progress on the board, let’s yak shave away a spring break making a fun little programming jig.</p>
