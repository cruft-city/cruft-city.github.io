I"€<p>My parents have had this old medium format camera sitting on a shelf for years and years. It turns out that this camera is none other than the Meopta Flexaret V. A medium format camera which was manufactured in the Czech Republic in 1958 (it was Czechoslovakia back then). I think it was a wedding present. Recently I became interested in trying to take some pictures with it.</p>
