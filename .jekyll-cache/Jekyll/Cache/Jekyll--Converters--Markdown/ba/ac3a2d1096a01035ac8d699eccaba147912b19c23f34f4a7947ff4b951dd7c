I"<p>A few years ago I got to do a workshop with some designers from New Balance. It was very cool to learn how they approach the design of footwear. The idea behind the workshop was to reimagine some aspect of footwear. The design I went with was a sports shoe designed to be as light and still provide good support. The upper would be knit for fit and breathability. Surrounding the uppoer is an organically inspired plastic mesh to provide stiffness and support. I used Houdini and took a procedural approach to the designs.</p>
