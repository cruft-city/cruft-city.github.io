I"«<p>In her 1895 book on the subject, feminist and prohibitionist Frances Willard called the bicycle a ‚Äústeed that never tires, and is ‚Äòmettlesome‚Äô in the fullest sense of the word‚Äù [1]. Although I agree in principle, I hope that my bicycle always tires.</p>

<p>Willard thought so highly of the bicycle and its potential as an equalizing force for women that she wrote a book called ‚ÄúA Wheel Within a Wheel‚Äù all about her journey with the bicycle. In the conclusion of her book, while summarizing why she learned to ride, she writes:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúI did it from pure natural love of adventure‚Äîa love long hampered and impeded, like a brook that runs underground, but in this enterprise bubbling up again with somewhat of its pristine freshness and taking its merry course as of old.</em></p>

<p>Second, from a love of acquiring this new implement of power and literally putting it underfoot.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, because a good many people thought I could not do it at my age.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that a bicycling costume was a prerequisite. This consisted of a skirt and blouse of tweed, with belt, rolling collar, and loose cravat, the skirt three inches from the ground; a round straw hat, and walking-shoes with gaiters. It was a simple, modest suit, to which no person of common sense could take exception.‚Äù &lt;/em&gt;</p>
