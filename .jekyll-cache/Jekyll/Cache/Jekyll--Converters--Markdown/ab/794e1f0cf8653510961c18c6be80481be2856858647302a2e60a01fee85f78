I"t<p>When I first started learning about dynamic systems and controls, I saw pendulums everywhere. As far as I could tell, pendulums had no real practical use significant enough to warrant this intense level of academic scrutiny. I knew I was missing something, so I went under cover and learned about dynamics and controls. Finally, here it is, the tell all, the pendulum exposé…</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-pendulum">What is a pendulum?</h2>

<p>This might be obvious, but for the sake of completeness, let’s start at the beginning. What is a pendulum? A pendulum is a thing that can turn around a joint. That’s maybe too general, but we usually find pendulums oriented vertically, like an arm hanging from a shoulder, so hopefully that narrows it down. Although as we will see later, sometimes it’s helpful to take a broad view about what qualifies as a pendulum. Below is an image that should clear up any further ambiguity.</p>

<p>The pendulum is a simple thing, conceptually at least, and that’s part of why it is so important not only to dynamics and controls, but to clocks and many other area. One of the earliest known scientific uses of the pendulum was a seismograph (a device for detecting earthquakes) invented by the royal astronomer Chang Heng in the year 132 AD in Han Dynasty China. This device used an inverted pendulum (a pendulum precariously balanced upside down), which fell and swung whenever the gound shook. When the pendulum fell, it dislodged one of a few balls arrayed around it to indicate the direction the earthquake came from [1]. Chang Heng’s pendulum is the first known scientific use of a pendulum, but bolas, slings and similar weapons are pendulum like as well and were incredibly fashionable technologies as long ago as 6,000 BC [2].</p>

<h2 id="the-pendulum-as-a-clock">The pendulum as a clock</h2>

<p>Somewhere after pendlums detected earthquakes in the palaces of ancient China and before they appeared in dynamic systems problem sets for engineering a physics students, the humble pendulum was the best known technology for timekeeping. Curiously, Gallileo studied the timekeeping ability of the pendulum as early as 1583, and even described to his son Vincenzio how a pendulum based clock could be made, but did not make the clock. Instead, the first pendulum clock wouldn’t arrive for another 74 years until 1657 when the illustrious Christian Huygens designed and built one. Between 1657 and sometime in the 1920’s or 1930’s, pendulum clocks were the most accurate way to keep track of the passing second [3].</p>

<p>The pendulum is useful for timekeeping because it <em>resonates</em>.</p>
