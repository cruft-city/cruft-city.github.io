I"û<p>This past semester, I wrote a story about a walk through a changing world. Itâ€™s called <em>A Walk</em>. Nick Montfort recommended I read Porter Abbotâ€™s <em>Cambridge Introduction to Narrative</em> which is a primer on narrative theory. Until this point, I had never actually learned any <em>real theory</em> about writing. Prior to my reading, I had heard some narrative theory jargon before, but these werenâ€™t much more than vague and lumpy estimations and uneducated guesses. The best I could muster was a sloppy synthesis of comments mentioned offhand by english teachers of the past all conglomerated and then blurred together by the fog of memory. Abbott made these things concrete. He starts by defining narrative (within his narrative theory) as â€œa representation of an event or series of eventsâ€ and then constructs the rest of the theory around it. The key point here is that a narrative is a <em>representation</em> of the events and that whenever events are represented, a narrative exists.</p>
