I"¼<p>I wanted to make a special baren as a christmas gift. Barens are tools for applying even pressure while making prints. This baren will be used to press linoleum stamps onto paper. I made the baren using a piece of scrap of cherry board that used to have nails in it for hanging small tools. I only used hand tools and sandpaper for this project.</p>

<p>First I drew some designs. All the barens Iâ€™ve seen are little circular presses with a horizontal handle across the top. I wanted to see if I could make a shape that was a bit more interesting and maybe more ergonomic as well. Something that would be fun to use. The idea was to make use of the fact that I wasnâ€™t going to be mass producing these, so I could make a nice curvy shape. Here are the designs I drew.</p>

<p>The first step in making the tool was to cut the board into three pieces and glue them together to make the stock for the handle. I roughed up the surface in hopes of getting a stronger joint, but I still had problems with the glue (as we will learn about later). After the glue had dried, I sketched the outline of the tool on the side to help with shaping.</p>

<p>Next step was rough shaping (and when I say rough, I mean rough). I did this with a hand saw and a mallet and chisel, holding the work in a vise on the bench. I had to be careful not to get carried away with the chisel because the wood split easily. At this point, it did not look pretty.</p>

<p>This was also my first run in with the glue failing. A small part of the palm rest broke off. I applied more glue this time and tried to maintain better clamping when it dried.</p>

<p>Next up was more shaping, this time with a big file and a couple of smaller rifflers. The rifflers were especially nice for blending the curves of the palm rest into the stem which connects it to the base.</p>

<p>The shaping is now complete.</p>

<p>After shaping came hours and hours of sanding. I used <strong>__</strong>__ grit to get out any of the large gouges left by the files. Next was <strong>__</strong> grit which made it easier to focus on the form, rather than how rough the surface was. I went back and forth between these two grits doing some final shaping. Then I moved on to <strong>__</strong> grit and finally <strong>__</strong>_ grit. This set of papers worked well, although maybe some intermediate grits would have made the process shorter, I am not sure. The final grit left the surface looking very smooth, so I didnt feel the need to go any finer.</p>

<p>After sanding it was time to finish the surface. I decided to go with pure tung oil because I liked the idea of a natural finish, and this tool didnâ€™t need any particularly impenetrable protective layer against mechanical damage or liquids. I applied it with a foam brush and waited a few days.</p>

<p>The tung oil developed this strange white cakey substance on the surface which I can only assume was excess tung oil that the wood sweat out and subsequently dried on the surface. This stuff was surprisingly hard to remove, even with sandpaper and I didnâ€™t particularly want to repeat the same set of papers as before. It turns out that the scouring pad on the back of a kitchen sponge works moderately well for removing the gunk without damaging the smooth surface beneath.</p>

<p>Finally, I used a small square of linoleum on the bottom for the soft, pressing surface. Despite roughing both surfaces and using moderately strong superglue, I anticipate having to re-glue the linoleum after some use.</p>

<p>The final piece:</p>

<p>The shape of the handle feels good in the hand and the surface is smooth and pleasant to the touch. I am pleasantly surprised by how well the sketch translated to the final object considering that it was challenging to use dimensions meaningfully for this process.</p>

<p>I used the following tools for this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A rubber mallet</li>
  <li>A framing chisel</li>
  <li>Sandpaper (GRITS)</li>
  <li>A small riffler</li>
  <li>A rough cut, half-round file</li>
  <li>A crosscut hand saw</li>
  <li>Not pictured: foam brush and pure tung oil.</li>
</ul>
