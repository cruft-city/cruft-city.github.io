I"a<p>I wanted to make a special baren as a christmas gift. Barens are tools for applying even pressure while making prints. This baren will be used to press linoleum stamps onto paper. I made the baren using a piece of scrap of cherry board that used to have nails in it for hanging small tools. I only used hand tools and sandpaper for this project.</p>
