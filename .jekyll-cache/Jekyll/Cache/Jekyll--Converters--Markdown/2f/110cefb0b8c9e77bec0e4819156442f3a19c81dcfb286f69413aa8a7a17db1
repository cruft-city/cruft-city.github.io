I"í<p>Prohibitionist Frances Willard called the bicycle a ‚Äústeed that never tires, and is ‚Äòmettlesome‚Äô in the fullest sense of the word‚Äù [1]. I hope that my bicycle always tires.</p>

<p>Willard thought so highly of the bicycle and its potential as an equalizing force for women that she wrote a book about it called ‚ÄúA Wheel Within a Wheel‚Äù all about her journey with the bicycle. In the conclusion of her book, while summarizing why she learned to ride, she writes</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúI did it from pure natural love of adventure‚Äîa love long hampered and impeded, like a brook that runs underground, but in this enterprise bubbling up again with somewhat of its pristine freshness and taking its merry course as of old.</em></p>

<p>Second, from a love of acquiring this new implement of power and literally putting it underfoot.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, because a good many people thought I could not do it at my age.</p>

<p>74It is needless to say that a bicycling costume was a prerequisite. This consisted of a skirt and blouse of tweed, with belt, rolling collar, and loose cravat, the skirt three inches from the ground; a round straw hat, and walking-shoes with gaiters. It was a simple, modest suit, to which no person of common sense could take exception.‚Äù &lt;/em&gt;</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-pendulum">What is a pendulum?</h2>

<p>This might be obvious, but for the sake of completeness, let‚Äôs start at the beginning. What is a pendulum? A pendulum is a thing that can turn around a joint. That‚Äôs maybe too general, but we usually find pendulums oriented vertically, like an arm hanging from a shoulder, so hopefully that narrows it down. Although as we will see later, sometimes it‚Äôs helpful to take a broad view about what qualifies as a pendulum. Below is an image that should clear up any further ambiguity.</p>

<p>The pendulum is a simple thing, conceptually at least, and that‚Äôs part of why it is so important not only to dynamics and controls, but to clocks and many other area. One of the earliest known scientific uses of the pendulum was a seismograph (a device for detecting earthquakes) invented by the royal astronomer Chang Heng in the year 132 AD in Han Dynasty China. This device used an inverted pendulum (a pendulum precariously balanced upside down), which fell and swung whenever the gound shook. When the pendulum fell, it dislodged one of a few balls arrayed around it to indicate the direction the earthquake came from [1]. Chang Heng‚Äôs pendulum is the first known scientific use of a pendulum, but bolas, slings and similar weapons are pendulum like as well and were incredibly fashionable technologies as long ago as 6,000 BC [2].</p>

<h2 id="the-pendulum-as-a-clock">The pendulum as a clock</h2>

<p>Somewhere after pendlums detected earthquakes in the palaces of ancient China and before they appeared in dynamic systems problem sets for engineering a physics students, the humble pendulum was the best known technology for timekeeping. Curiously, Gallileo studied the timekeeping ability of the pendulum as early as 1583, and even described to his son Vincenzio how a pendulum based clock could be made, but did not make the clock. Instead, the first pendulum clock wouldn‚Äôt arrive for another 74 years until 1657 when the illustrious Christian Huygens designed and built one. Between 1657 and sometime in the 1920‚Äôs or 1930‚Äôs, pendulum clocks were the most accurate way to keep track of the passing second [3].</p>

<p>The pendulum is useful for timekeeping because it <em>resonates</em>.</p>
