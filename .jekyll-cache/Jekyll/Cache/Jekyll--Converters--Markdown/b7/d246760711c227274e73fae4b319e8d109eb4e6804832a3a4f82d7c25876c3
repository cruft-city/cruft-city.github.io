I"{<p>In her 1895 book on the subject, feminist and prohibitionist Frances Willard called the bicycle a “steed that never tires, and is ‘mettlesome’ in the fullest sense of the word” [1]. Although I agree in principle, I hope that my bicycle always tires.</p>

<p>Willard thought so highly of the bicycle and its potential as an equalizing force for women that she wrote a book called “A Wheel Within a Wheel” all about her journey with the bicycle. In the conclusion of her book, while summarizing why she learned to ride, she writes:</p>

<p><em>“I did it from pure natural love of adventure—a love long hampered and impeded, like a brook that runs underground, but in this enterprise bubbling up again with somewhat of its pristine freshness and taking its merry course as of old.</em></p>

<p><em>“Second, from a love of acquiring this new implement of power and literally putting it underfoot.</em></p>

<p><em>“Last, but not least, because a good many people thought I could not do it at my age.” </em></p>
